# landing-page
Its really been amazing having coming this far ! i knew nothing about web development few weeks back, thanks to the odin project, now i am able to build a basic page and design it without looking at any other persons code !!!! .. this has really been an inspirations for me to keep pushing forward and working my way to becoming a full tech person not just in web development but also other fields. 
here is just a piece of what i have learned so far from the odin project, i customized the reference image odin provided and personalized it a little bit to give it a personal look.
